Note: Due to the size of the worldwide population numbers and the fact that percentages are needed to calculate population growth, this problem cannot be solved with int variables. 

Please tell your students to use type double to declare their variables and to input values from the user with Scanner method nextDouble. Also, you should have them output the values using System.out.printf and the format specifier %.0f.

Alternatively, you could have them solve the problem without using input and simply hard code the current world population and current growth rate into the calculations.
